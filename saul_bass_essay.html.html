    title="Saul Bass was born on the 8th May 1920"/>Saul Bass was a famous American graphic designer and filmmaker, best known for his iconic movie poster designs, title sequences and an array of long-lasting corporate logos. Saul was born on the 8th May 1920 in The Bronx, New York. After a childhood of drawing and creating art, he went on to study at Brooklyn College, taught by Gyorgy Kepes. After this, Bass received a fellowship from the prestigious school, the Art Students League in Manhattan. After his studies, Saul moved from New York to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time career in freelance graphic design. In LA, Bass worked as a freelance designer and commercial advertiser, working for companies such as Warner Brothers; he would later go on to create their famous logo before turning his hand to film. </p>

<div class="film">
    <p><img class="carmen" src="images/carmen_jones.jpg"  alt="Carmen Jones (1954)"
    title="Carmen Jones (1954)"/>Bass first entered the world of Hollywood in the mid-1950s when the film world was undergoing incredible change; eventually, his contribution to film became a catalyst for this change. He found his place in the industry as an on-set visual consultant, working with many famous directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, and Otto Preminger.</p>
                
    <p>One of Saul's first big assignments as a designer came when he was offered the role to design a movie poster for legendary filmmaker, Otto Preminger. He designed the poster for the film, ‘Carmen Jones’ and received overwhelming praise for his creation. Preminger was so impressed by the poster and the feedback it received, that he commissioned Saul Bass to also design the opening titles for the film. After designing his first title sequence, Bass fell in love with the process. He wanted to bring life to graphics and film, and make titles a more enjoyable experience for the audience. This experience truly launched Bass’ motion graphics career.</p>
                
    <blockquote>“For the average audience, the credits tell them there’s only three minutes left to eat popcorn. I take this ‘dead’ period and try to do more than simply get rid of names that filmgoers aren’t interested in. I aim to set up the audience for what’s coming; make them expectant.”<cite>—Saul Bass [1]</cite></blockquote>
                
    <p><img class="gold" src="images/golden_arm.jpg" alt="The Man with the Golden Arm (1955)"
    title="The Man with the Golden Arm (1955)"/>Bass was the first person to realise the creative potential in the opening and closing credits of a film. Before this, the projectionist opened the cinema curtains after the movie titles had passed because they were so dull and boring. However, once ‘The Man With the Golden Arm’ arrived in cinemas across the US, there was a note taped to the reel saying, “Projectionists: pull curtain before titles.” Preminger wanted his audience to see ‘The Man with the Golden Arms’ opening title as an integral part of the film. The sequence featured a black cut out animated heroin addict’s arm. Bass knew that the arm was a very powerful image of drug abuse and addiction. Bass chose to use the arm rather than Frank Sinatra’s face as the main symbol for the movie poster and the opening titles. His powerful title sequence for ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ changed the way both directors and designers would treat opening titles forever. He brought a new element to filmmaking during the sixties, fashioning title sequences into an art; a prologue to the movie, using a combination of intellect and emotion with a modernist-leaning approach.</p>
                
<div class="MSQuote">
    <blockquote>“When his work comes up on the screen, the movie itself truly begins.”
    <cite>—Martin Scorsese [2]</cite></blockquote>
</div>
                
    <p><img class="love" src="images/love_afternoon.jpg"  alt="Love in the Afternoon (1957)"
    title="Love in the Afternoon (1957)"/>His title sequences were of similar style to his posters but with a more dynamic element. Saul revolutionised title sequences with his innovative design styles and unique typography techniques. Bass famously used ‘Kinetic Typography' combined with dominate primary colours to great effect. This form of typography is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. Early feature films contained traditional typography, but this was mostly static text, presented sequentially and transitions were done by hand.</p>

    <p>Many recognise the first feature film to extensively use kinetic typography as Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959). As we know, this film's opening title sequence was created by Saul Bass, featuring animated credits that "flew" in from off-screen, and finally faded out into the film itself. A similar technique was also used by Bass in Psycho (1960). Saul Bass created title sequences for more than 50 motion pictures during his 50-year career, yet his work always remained both new and provocative. His craft always held a sophisticated message in every design he worked on, simplistic on the surface but with a very significant underlying meaning. All of his work reflected his minimalistic style, modernist approach and use of vibrant primary colours to create emphasis across all of his pieces. He revamped the aesthetics of film forever: his style is still emulated today.</p>

    <blockquote>“Saul Bass wasn’t just an artist who contributed to the first several minutes of some of the greatest movies in history; in my opinion, his body of work qualifies him as one of the best film makers of this, or any other time.”<cite>—Steven Spielberg [3]</cite></blockquote>

<div class="logos">
    <p><img class="logolist" src="images/logos.gif"  alt="Saul Bass' Logos" title="Saul Bass' Logos"/>Saul Bass is claimed by many, to be the single most accomplished graphic designer in history. Although best known for his contribution to film, Bass also branded a large number of major corporations with his iconic, minimal designs when the importance of graphic design was just finding its feet.</p>
            
    <p>Bass created a variety of long lasting logos for large corporations such as AT&T, Bell, Kleenex and many more. The average life span of a ‘Saul Bass designed’ logo is 35 years according to research conducted by Christian Annyas. He researched 23 different logos and concluded 21 years after Bass’ death, 13 of these logos remain the same (including any refreshed logos). Six logos died as a result of company bankruptcy or mergers but only four logos were completely redesigned and replaced. These statistics really show the longevity of Bass’ logo designs; timeless.</p>
            
    <blockquote>“I came back with 1500 slides. Saul and I were in a late night meeting discussing what the Continental look meant and what inference we could make for a new Continental logo design as the beginning of a new image program. I remember Saul saying something like, “If this were Western Airlines, we would just make a ‘western’ looking logo complete with an ‘out west look’ reminiscent of cowboy gear.” But this was Continental, an airline known at the time for its high service image.”<cite>—Logo designer, William Haig recalls working with Bass on the Continental Airlines logo [5]</cite></blockquote>
            
    <p>Of all his designs, arguably his most famous was the creation of AT&T’s logo. This logo was re-designed from the previous ‘bell’ icon, also designed by Saul Bass. The ‘bell’ logo served from 1969 until 1983 when Bass introduced the better known ‘globe’ graphic still used today. This logo became known as the ‘death star’ logo. The individual horizontal lines which covers the globe represents world wide communication. The logo style is believed to be a ‘combination mark.’ It includes two visual elements, the prominent logo mark and the use of logo type, more specifically a letter mark as it is an acronym (American Telephone & Telegraph).</p>
            
    <blockquote>“The symbol creates the uniqueness in the mark. So the lettering in the logotype can remain clear and easy to read. The symbol becomes a flag, by itself the logo type is just another word in a sea of words, but combined, the symbol serves as a focal point, directing attention to the name.” <cite>—Saul Bass [6]</cite></blockquote>
                    
    <p>The letter mark element of the logo is a bold, monolithic sans-serif typeface, developed in the previous ‘bell’ version of the design. This, along with the blue colour of the graphic, was kept in the 1983 version when the globe was introduced. Over more than 40 years later, the AT&T logo has been modified slightly with added dimension. Today, the brand still represents Saul Bass’ original style first conjured in 1983. Some slight refinements made in 2015 include a change in typeface and more curvature in the lines on the globe. </p>

    <p>Designers today are still being influenced by Saul Bass and the elements unique to his movie posters. Three examples of his continuing influence are shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="influ2">
    <p>The poster for Lee Daniel’s ‘Precious’ was designed by LA company ‘Ignition Creative.’ The use of a dominant orange background with a contrasting black graphic of the subject of the movie; an overweight, abused, illiterate teen, is very similar to the style of Bass’ work. I particularly like the hand formed within the girl’s silhouette, perhaps suggesting her desperation to escape the life she finds herself in.</p>
</div>
    <img class="precious" src="images/precious.jpg" title="Precious (2009)" width="200" height="300"/>
        
<div class="influ3">
    <p>Another element of Saul Bass’ movie poster designs that has been replicated is his use of obscure typography. Here we see the poster for the 2008 film, ‘Burn After Reading’ taking obvious inspiration from Bass’ typeface featured on the poster for the 1958 psychological thriller ‘Vertigo.’</p>
</div>
    <img class="burn" src="images/burn_vertigo.gif" title="Burn After Reading (2008) vs. Vertigo (1958)"/>
<div class="influ4">
    <p>The artwork designer for the band ‘The White Stripes’ would also appear to be a fan of Bass’ work. The artwork for the single, ‘The Hardest Button to Button’ is very similar to the opening title sequence for ‘The Man With The Golden Arm.’ The designer claims the cover represents Jack White's broken index finger and his strange obsession with the number 3.</p>

<div class="heading5"><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
</div>
                
<div class="conclusion">
    <p>Saul Bass was a man ahead of his time, he will forever be deemed a legend by the design world. Leading the modernist art movement of the 20th century, Bass helped shape the future of graphic design. His vision of potential was revolutionary, he creates his own opportunities and capitalised on them to create a name for himself. The work of Saul Bass in both film and corporate branding will remain an integral part of design history forever. His logic and skill combined with knowledge of both industries helped bring a broader dimension to design, leaving a legacy that will last forever.</p>
